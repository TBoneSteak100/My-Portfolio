                I am a third year Information Systems student, the current RC Finance, Maintenance and Breakages of House ConLaures residence at the UFS, and the current Events and Projects Manager of FIN-CONNECT Student Association. As a hobby I am a chorister, 2019 I became part of the KwaZulu Natal Midlands Youth Choir, still in 2019 I was also part of the Joseph And The Amazing Technicolor Dream Coat which was a musical theatre production, from 2021 to the end of 2022 I was part of the University of the Free State Choir, and I am currently in the City Of Roses Choir which will be engaged in the upcoming World Choir Games taking place this July at South Korea. I am also a voluntary ConLaures residence tutors, which recently gained the recruitment from the university to work with the university tutors under the Center for Teaching and Learning department of the university.
                I believe I am an enthusiastic person who like grabbing opportunities that I are granted to me and invest my efforts and time wholeheartedly to ensure that everything works as intended and necessary tasks are accomplished. Additionally, I am an individual who values assisting where I see an opportunity to do so, this includes community service initiative that would be hosted more especially in my community.
