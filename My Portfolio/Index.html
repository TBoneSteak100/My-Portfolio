        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <br>
        <h3>My name is Thobani Phungula</h3>
        <br>
    
        <p id="p1">
            I am a third-year Information Systems student, currently serving as the RC for Finance, Maintenance, and Breakages at House ConLaures residence at UFS, as well as the Events and Projects Manager for the FIN-CONNECT Student Association. Outside of academics, I enjoy choral singing. In 2019, I joined the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands Youth Choir and also participated in the musical theatre production *Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat*. From 2021 to 2022, I was a member of the University of the Free State Choir, and I currently sing with the City of Roses Choir, which will compete in the upcoming World Choir Games in South Korea this July. 
            Additionally, I volunteer as a tutor at ConLaures residence and was recently recruited by the university to collaborate with tutors under the Center for Teaching and Learning department. 
            I am a passionate and proactive individual who seizes opportunities and dedicates my efforts to achieving desired outcomes. I also have a strong commitment to helping others, particularly through community service initiatives, especially those that benefit my local community.
